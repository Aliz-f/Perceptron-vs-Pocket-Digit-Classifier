# Perceptron-vs-Pocket-Digit-Classifier
This repository contains implementations of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA) and Pocket Algorithm for handwritten digit recognition. The goal is to classify digits using two features extracted from the images—average intensity and symmetry—and improve the model's performance by adding a third custom feature.
